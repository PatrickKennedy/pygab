
PyGab - A Python Jabber Framework
=================================

PyGab was born from Perry Lorier's Google Talk: Conference Bot and looks to be
modularly extensible, making extensive use of plugins (Work In Progress).

Requirements
------------

 - Python >= 2.5

 - Dependancies below this point are included with the source.

 - XMPPPy 0.4.2
   http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net

 - Dict4Ini 0.9.5

 - Argparse 0.9.0

Installing & Running
--------------------

Bots are separated into (<name>.py, /<name>/) pairs:

  ex: gbot.py, /gbot/

Module specific code stored in it's folder:

  ex: /gbot/plugins/

Templates for each module's various ini files are stored in /templates/:

  ex: /templates/<name>-config.ini

When running a bot for the first time you'll need to copy all templates to the
module's folder and strip "<name>-" from the front of them. You are then free to
make any adjustments you like. This will eventually be automatic.

To run a bot just execute it's <name>.py file in the root folder:

  ex: python gbot.py
